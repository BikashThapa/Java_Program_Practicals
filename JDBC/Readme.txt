The Driver for the Mysql Connector is not registered as default in eclipse. 
So we need to add the jar file from the system on the project and the download link for the jar file is  https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java
Download the latest version if possible and supported.
Neatbeans already have the connector so no need to import them.
